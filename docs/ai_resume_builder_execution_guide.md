### 4.2. System Design for AI Features

#### 4.2.1. Real-time ATS Scoring

1.  The frontend will send the user's resume and the job description to the backend every 5-10 seconds as the user types.
2.  The backend will use the "Resume ATS Scoring" prompt to get the ATS score and suggestions from the OpenAI API.
3.  The backend will return the score and suggestions to the frontend.
4.  The frontend will update the UI in real-time to display the new score and feedback.

#### 4.2.2. "Fix with AI" Functionality

1.  When the user clicks the "Fix with AI" button for a specific suggestion, the frontend will send the relevant text and the suggestion to the backend.
2.  The backend will use the appropriate prompt (e.g., "Bullet Point Optimization") to get the improved text from the OpenAI API.
3.  The backend will return the improved text to the frontend.
4.  The frontend will display the suggested change to the user, who can then accept or reject it.

#### 4.2.3. Competitor Analysis

1.  The backend will maintain a database of common skills and keywords for different job titles and industries.
2.  When a user analyzes a job description, the backend will compare the extracted keywords to its database to identify common patterns.
3.  The backend will return a list of skills and keywords that are likely to be on other applicants' resumes.
4.  The frontend will display this information to the user as "competitor analysis."

### 4.3. User Interaction Flows

#### 4.3.1. Onboarding Flow

1.  User signs up for a free account.
2.  User is prompted to either upload a resume or start from a template.
3.  User is guided through the resume editor with a short interactive tutorial.
4.  User is encouraged to paste a job description to see the real-time ATS scoring in action.

#### 4.3.2. Upgrade Flow

1.  When a free user hits a usage limit (e.g., tries to create a second resume), they are shown a modal with the pricing plans.
2.  The modal highlights the benefits of the paid plans, such as unlimited resumes and full ATS optimization.
3.  The user can choose a plan and enter their payment information through a Stripe-powered form.
4.  Once the payment is successful, the user's account is upgraded and they can access the premium features.
